# 42intra_scraper


Scrap the 42 Intranet's elearning videos in a single click.

### Why you would want to use it ?

1. Adjust speed at your convenience. (The intra doesn't allow this)
2. Working in a remote location where internet is hit or miss ? Download what you need and you'll have it in your computer.
3. Have a friend that is freeze and can't access the intra's resources ? You can download the videos, compress them and send them via drive. 


### How to use it:

```
git clone git@github.com:Dovalich/42intra_scraper.git
```
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
```
python3 intra_scraper.py
```

And then all you have to do is follow the instructions that the program gives you, that is:

1. enter your 42 intranet username
2. enter your 42 intranet password
3. enter the elearning link you want to scrap for example https://elearning.intra.42.fr/tags/38/notions

## How does it work ?

It's fairly simple.

1. The program makes a post request to the intranet using your logins (via the requests module).

2. Once logged-in, it recursively searches for any links that are in the middle of the page (the ones that contain videos)

3. Once it finds a video link it downloads it based on the video quality you chose (SD or HD)

(there are some steps that I ommited in the explanation like getting the authenticity token using a get request or creating a directory for each section but they are not relevant... Oops I justed explained them)

### Note 

As you can see in the code I don't store your user name and password. In fact I only use them once to login. But be careful when using these types of scripts. You should always read the source code before giving away sensitive information.
